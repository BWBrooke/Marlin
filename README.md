# How and Why Upgrade JellyBOX Firmware

You can think of firmware as the sum of your printer's knowledge and skills. It's the contents of its imaginary brain. It's a piece of software directly controlling the motors and temperatures and interpreting the gcode. 

The firmware that came with your JellyBOX works fine, but if there is a newer firmware available, you should upgrade. We constantly work to bring you new features and fix any mistakes we may discover.  

## Upgrading the firmware takes only a few minutes and it's not difficult at all: 

1. You download the latest firmware from our website. 
2. You connect your JellyBOX to the computer with a USB cable
3. You run the upgrade procedure using Cura - the same program you are already using to slice your 3D models. 
4. That's it. 

Let me show you. 

- Go to the imade3d support page and download the latest firmware.

    - If you are tech inclined, you can always find the latest firmware ready to hack on our Github. https://github.com/IMADE3D/Marlin/releases
- Connect your JellyBOX to a computer with a USB cable. 
- Start Cura. Go to Settings > Printer > Manage Printers.

- Select the file you just downloaded with .hex extension
- Wait a bit. 
- And it's done!
- Restart your JellyBOX.  Watch the splash screen and you will see your JellyBOX is running a new firmware version. 

## Compile JB-Marlin from Source

If you want to compile from source, you can. 

You have to use the correct Configuration.h file! Go to Marlin/JellyBOX_configurations and to find the one one need.

To use one of these configurations, simply copy it, and then paste and OVERWRITE the Configuration.h in Marlin folder.

Finally, compile and flash with the latest Arduino IDE (https://www.arduino.cc/). You will also need to have the U8GLIB library installed (from zip or through the Arduino library manager.)
